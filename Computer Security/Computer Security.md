# Computer Security

## Basic concepts
Security requirements: CIA paradigm
- Confidentiality: information can only be accessed by thos who are authorized
- Integrity: information can only be modified by authorized entities and only in the way such entities are entitled to modify them
- Availability: information must be available to all the parties that have the right to access it, within specified time constraint

Starting from here we can see that "A" conflicts with "C" and "I" and this is what makes security hard. I cannot encrypt the data and store them at the bottom of the ocean and call that secure, there are business requirements and time requirements that need to be satisfied that have become stricter and stricter over time.

### Definitions
- Vulnerability: a "shortcut" through the security process that undermines our assumptions that can potentially allow to violate the CIA paradigm.
- Exploit: a specific way to use one or more vulnerabilities to accomplish a specific objective that violates the constraint

There can be a vulnerability without having a working exploit.  
Also some vulnerabilities cannot be completely removed because it would be too inconvenient (impacting usability) or because they are too embedded in the system (hw vulnerabilites like spectre and meltdown). In those case we can only mitigate the vulnerability, we try to make it more difficult to exploit.

Security != protection -> it depends on the threat model we are defending against. We can only make comparisons in the same environment for the same type of threat.

- Threat modeling: defining what **assets** we are protecting against what **threats**
  - Assets: valuable things (yes, things, it can be anything: hw, sw, data, reputation,...) that we want to protect
  - Threats: who and in which ways can damage our assets
- Attack: *intentional* use of one or more exploits to violate the CIA properties of a target system
- Threat agent: whoever is carrying out the attack, also known as attacker

IMPORTANT NOTE:  
attacker != hacker  
an hacker is just someone with advanced understanding of computers and networks while an attakcer seeks to do damage and it's not necessarily knowledgable (see "cybercrime as a service" in DFC course)

- Risks: Evaluation of the probability of something bad happening to our assets and the damage that it would cause.

RISK = ASSETS x VULNERABILITIES x THREATS

The objective of security is to balance the reduction of the vulnerabilities and the damage containment versus the cost that this will bring to the organization (both direct like, management, operational and equipment and indirect like slower performance, less usability, less privacy).

ANOTHER NOTE:  
more money does not imply more security, we need to configure it appropriately and make sure that our users will not have to leave password on sticky notes under the monitor!

### Trust
We need to define boundaries, some part of the system that will be assumed to be secure (*trusted elements*). Those boundaries change depending on the threat model and on how much trouble/cost are we willing to go through to check everything. Examples of trusted elements for normal users can be the hw of the machine we are using or the operating system that is running. If you are a high profile target (like NSA) maybe you also want also to check those.  
Of course if an attacker is able to compromise something in our trusted elements then all our security assumptions will fall.

## Cryptography
Principles:
- encryption mechanism is known to the attacker
- we want to ensure forward secrecy (cannot read previous messages even if the key is broken in the future)
- key needs to be long enough to avoid bruteforcing

KERCKHOFFS'S PRINCIPLE:  
The security of the crypto system relies only on the secrecy of the key and never on the secrecy of the algorithm.

### Perfect cipher
A perfect cipher is a cipher in which an attacker doesn't gain any more knowledge about the message when he sees the ciphertext:
- `P(M=m)` probability that the message sent is `m`
- `P(M=m|C=c)` probability that the message sent is `m` given that the ciphertext is `c`

In a perfect cipher we have that:  
`P(M=m) = P(M=m|C=c)`  
In order to achieve this we need to have a key that is at least as large as the message. This immedialtely highlights the impracticality of such ciphers even if they are practically possible: i need to share a key as long as the message before starting the communication ([One Time Pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad)).

### Breaking ciphers
A real world cipher is not perfect and we say that a cipher is broken when there exists a faster way to break it than bruteforcing. There are different types of attacks:
- ciphertext attacks: the attacker only has the ciphertext.
- known plaintext attacks: the attacker has a set of pairs of corresponding plaintext-ciphertext.
- chosen plaintext attacks: the attacker can choose plaintexts and obtain the respective ciphertext.  

We cannot prove that a certain cipher is not broken, we can only find out if it is broken by trying to break it. This is why it is important in cryptogrphy to always use well known and tested techniques that have been around for some time and not trying to reinvent the wheel.

### Symmetric encryption
A type of encryption that uses the same key for ecnrypting and decrypting the message. The key needs to be exchanged securely by the two parties.

Symmetric ciphers are based on two principles (see [confusion and diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_and_diffusion)):
- substitution: replace each byte with another one, provides confusion
  - monoalphabetic: fixed transformation table
  - polyalphabetic: transformation table depends on the position
- transposition: swaps bytes with one another, provides diffusion

Moder ciphers use a mix of both techniques repeated for many *rounds* and ties them to the bit of the key. The length of the key plays a big role in the security of the cipher because a key that is too short can be bruteforced:
- DES key -> 56 bits -> 2^56 combination -> can be bruteforced on modern hw with little time and effort.
- AES key -> 128 bits -> 2^128 combination -> cannot be bruteforced even by supercomputers, it will take millions of years and we can always extend it to 256 bits.

Of course since it is not feasible to attack directly the key or the cipher a threat actor will find some other, easier ways to break into the system ([like this...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis) [;)](https://xkcd.com/538/))

### Asymmetric encryption
The concept is: we have a cipher that uses two keys, one foe encrypting and one for decrypting. Thos keys can be retrieved from each other and are generated using a one way mathematical function (we will not go into the details).  
The advantage over symmetric encryption is that we can exchange the key to encrypt messages directly on the internet (public key) and keep the decryption key secret (private key).  
But this arise a new problem: how can i be sure that the key i am using to encrypt a message belongs to the one i want to send the message to? See PKI after.

DIFFIE-HELLMAN KEY EXCHANGE  
Not an asymmetric cipher but uses the principles behind those to have two entities agree on a shared secret over an insecure channel.  
The one-way function used here is the discrete logarithm:
- easy to compute `y = a^x mod p`
- difficult to compute `x = log(y)`

How does the exchange work? Suppose that we have two entities A and B that want to have a shared secret (for mathematical details [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffieâ€“Hellman_key_exchange)):
- A and B agree on a large prime number `p` and the base `a` that they are going to use (public information)
- both of them then choose a secret number, A chooses `x` and B chooses `y` and keeps them private
- A computes `a^x mod p`
- B computes `a^y mod p`
- they exchange what they have computed, now they both have `a^x` and `a^y` (each without knowing the number chosen by the other)
- A computes `(a^y)^x = a^xy (always mod p)`
- B similarly computes `(a^x)^y = a^yx`
- since `a^xy = a^yx` they now have a shared secret.

An attacker listening on the channel cannot compute `a^xy` without knowing one of the two secrets `x` or `y` and he cannot get them from `a^x` or `a^y` since it is not feasible to compute the logarithm.

### Hash functions
Funciton `H` that maps an input `x` of arbitrary length to a fixed length output `h`. Since the dimension of the output space is lower than the one of the input there are going to be *collisions*: two (or more) inputs mapped onto the same output.  
For cryptogrphic applications we want to limit as much as possible the probability of this happening, in particular it must be computationally unfeasible to:
1. find and input `x` such that `H(x) = h'`. I don't want to be possible that i can generate a input `x` to obtain a specific hash `h'`. This is called preimage attack resistance.
2. given `x`, find an input `y != x` such that `H(x) = H(y)`. This is called second preimage attack resistance.
3. find a couple of inputs `x` and `y` such that `H(x) = H(y)`. This is called collision resistance.

NOTE: 1 implies 2 but not viceversa.

A hash function is broken if a collision can be found faster than bruteforcing, that means (`n` is the hash length):
- for 1 and 2 choosing at random: collision once in `2^n-1`
- for 3 always at random: collision once in `2^n/2`

Why do we want hash functions?  
They can be used to ensure integrity of files (compute hash at source and destination and compare them to see if they are the same, if not the file is corrupted/modified) and in general they provide a unique "signature" to a certain file that uniquely identifies it.  
The most used hash functions are the one in the SHA family:
- use SHA-2 or better SHA-3. SHA-1 is considered broken
- DO NOT use MD5 pls

### Digital signature
Aims at solving the problem of authenticating a certain message, that is guaranteeing that it comes from a certain person.  
This is achieved using the same asymmetric encryption algorithms but with public and private key's roles are swapped:
- the (hash of the) message is encrypted with the private key, only the one who possess that is able to produce it. This is what we call *signature*
- the signature can be verified by anyone that possess the public key:
  - decrypt the (hash of the) message with the public key
  - compare the (hash of the) message with the one received
  - if they are the same then the content of the message was signed by the one who sent it

The digital signature is stronger than a handwritten signature because it is tied to the content of the message, so a message that has been signed cannot be modified without also altering the resulting signature and the signature itself cannot be copied and pasted on a different document.  
We need to ensure WYSIWYS "What You See Is What You Sign"!  
For examples it is not good to sign documents that can contain macros that modifies the **displayed** content of file because this will allow the content to change without changing the signature.

### Public key infrastructure (PKI)
We need a system to correctly associate each public key with its respective owner in order to be sure to use the correct key for sending messages.  
This is achieved using *certificates* issued by *certification authorities* (CA). A CA is a **trusted** third party that digitally signs a certificate that binds an identity to a public key (see [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509)).  
The idea behind the mechanism is similar to how a government issues identity documents to his citizens. As long as i trust the state that released the document i can trust the content of the document.  
In certificates we can check which CA has signed the certificate and decide to trust it or not. But how can we verifiy the CA key? It's signed by another CA! Then this CA can be recursively verified until we reach the a ROOT CA, a CA that signed it's own certificate (basically saying "i am myself").  
This root CA is a trusted element of the infrastructure. There exists many root CAs and most of their certificates are bundler directly into the OSes and browsers that we use.

#### Certificate revocation
Since digital signature cannot be destryoed once they are issued we need ways to make a certificate invalid (for example if we discover that the private key of the CA has been leaked):
- Expiration dates on certificates, to ensure that eventually they will be removed.
- Certificate Revocation List (CRL) where all the revoked certificates are published, expired or not.

#### Verification steps for certificates
1. Does the signature validate the document? check hash
2. Is the public key the one on the certificate?
3. Is the certificate the one of the subject?
4. Is the certificate validated by a CA? validate recursively the entire chain of CAs
5. Is the root CA trusted?
6. Is the certificate in a CRL? (what if we are not online?)

All this process assumes that the root CA is a trusted element and all the intermediate CAs have not been compromised. If they are, there is no automatic way to tell.
