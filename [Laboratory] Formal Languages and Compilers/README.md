# FLC LAB

This contains notes from the FLC laboratory lectures. 
In particular, this material covers the presentation of the ACSE compiler and how it works.

It should be useful if you are preparing the laboratory since the logic shown here can be reused to build other constructs for the exams.

The material is based on the slides shown by Daniele Cattaneo during the lecture, the code is the same with some added comments for clarity.

## ACSE version

The ACSE version that these notes are based on is v1.2.3. Some adjustments may be required if a new version of ACSE is released.

Please refer to the most recent ACSE documentation during the exam. Instruction abount compilation and testing are also there.
